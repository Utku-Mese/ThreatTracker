        <h4>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</h4>
        <p>DDoS attack stands for "Distributed Denial of Service." These types of attacks aim to render a website, network, or online service unusable by overwhelming it with excessive traffic. High volumes of traffic from many different sources consume the resources of the target system and prevent normal users from accessing it. DDoS attacks are typically carried out using large computer networks controlled by malicious software known as botnets.</p>

        <h4>Ransomware</h4>
        <p>Ransomware is a combination of the words "Ransom Software." This type of malware encrypts a user's or organization's data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. Attackers often specify that the data will remain inaccessible until the payment is made. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out through phishing emails or malicious software exploiting vulnerabilities.</p>

    <div id="attackDictList" class="attackDictList">
        <h4>SQL Injection (Structured Query Language Injection)</h4>
        <p>SQL Injection allows an attacker to execute unauthorized operations such as unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion by manipulating the SQL queries sent by a web application to its database. SQL Injection is carried out through web applications that do not properly filter or sanitize user inputs. Such attacks can lead to theft of sensitive data, database corruption, and other security vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h4>Phishing (Password Harvesting Fishing)</h4>
        <p>Phishing aims to deceive users into providing personal or sensitive information using fake or misleading messages. It is often conducted through fake emails, websites, or social media messages. Phishing attacks result in users falling victim to identity theft, exposing sensitive information, and allowing malicious actors to misuse that information.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="attackDictList" class="attackDictList">
        <h4>Vishing (Voice Phishing)</h4>
        <p>Vishing is conducted through telecommunications tools, especially phone calls. Attackers attempt to obtain sensitive information from their victims by contacting them with fake identities or organizations. Vishing attacks can be carried out using fake call centers, voice messages, or automated response systems.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="attackDictList" class="attackDictList">
        <h4>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)</h4>
        <p>XSS is a type of attack that allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in users' browsers using security vulnerabilities in web applications. XSS attacks are often used to harm users, steal sessions, or steal sensitive information.</p>
